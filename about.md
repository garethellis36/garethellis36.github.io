I have been a full-time web developer since 2013. Before this I worked in a non-technical role doing things like project management, account management, supplier management... lots of things ending in "management", basically!   
   
Having initially learned PHP in 2002 and then not looked at it for years, I am frantically trying to level-up my dev skills and am learning things regularly.   
   
This blog is an attempt to record interesting things I happen across and (what I hope are) good solutions to problems I encounter in my work.      
   
I welcome any feedback on my posts - please get in touch via Twitter (see username at the bottom of this page).
